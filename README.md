This is a small webpage that takes an array in the format [1,2,3,4....] so on as an array representation of a binary tree and renders it on the screen.
I built this specifically to help me visualise binary trees while solving leetcode style problems because they often use arrays as an input in the testcases.

To run use npm run build:dev or npm run build:prod and use the generated files in dist.
